## Premade Options

The New Maps Projects offers many premade options for map data to put into the Editing Suite. These options show on the homepage when first opening the website and in the Datastore

### Datastore

The New Maps Project Datastore contains files that are in the format to be inputed into the Editing Suite. Most of the data is retreived from the US Census, but the data is purely made for demonstrative purposed and is **not in guaranteed to be accurate.** Please read the disclaimers for this website.

The files have some general information displayed about them on the datastore page, such as the state the precincts are generally in, or the number of districts in the map. Most of the files provided use ZIP codes as precincts and have precincts which are unassigned. 

### Homepage Options

The options displayed in the homepage options use files from the Datastore. The "view the map" button imports the data from the file into the Editing Suite, while the "Draw the Districts" button will import the data into the Editing Suite and then automatically run The New Maps Project Redistricting Algorithm on the data, using *default settings* specific to each set of data. 

Usually a hovering box will appear with estimated runtime and miniumun RSD values when hoveirng over the "Draw the Districts" button for each homepage option.
